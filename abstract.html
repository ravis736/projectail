            The North-eastern India is one of the hotspot of mega biodiversity centre of the world which falls in
            between
            Eastern Himalayan belt and Indo-Burmese Region. The prospects of the region include mega biodiversity hot
            spot
            areas and abundant natural resources such as land and soils, minerals, industrial resources like oils,
            forest
            covers, agricultural land, rivers, indigenous crop germplasm, flowers and ornamental plants, medicinal and
            aromatic plants, livestock, poultry and fisheries. Prevalence of diverse agro-climatic conditions and
            natural
            vegetation have become a niche of a number of native germplasm of cereals, grain legumes, oil seeds, tuber
            crops, fruits, vegetables, spices, medicinal and aromatic plants and indigenous farming systems for
            sustenance
            of rural population. <br><br>
            Land is a critical resource in many of the north-east states. The region’s agricultural system is
            predominantly traditional. The overall geographical land to man ratio for the north-east region
            (0.67 hectare / person) is much higher than the national average (0.32 hectare/person). Population
            to land ratio is highest in Arunachal Pradesh followed by Mizoram, Sikkim and Manipur. The soil of
            the region is acidic to strongly acidic in nature accounting 70 percent of the total geographical
            area Low soil pH is basically due to leaching of the bases under the influence of heavy
            precipitation. Soils are rich in organic matter. Forest cover in the region is 14.2 million ha which
            is about 54.16per cent of total geographical area, even higher than the national average (19.39 per
            cent). Mostly, the region is characterized by fragility, marginality, inaccessibility, cultural
            heterogeneity, ethnicity and rich in biodiversity. Judicious utilization and conservation of natural
            resources is the approach in the farming system concurrent policy and research back up to increase
            production, add value to the produce and market management.
